1.Primitive vs Reference types 

Primitive data types are: numbers, strings, booleans, undefined, and null (also symbols so check 
those out). Basically, if it’s storing a simple piece of data, it’s stored simply. When you set a 
variable with this type, the variable is that exact value and that’s all. If you change that value, 
the variable simply becomes a new value.That means the two reference types are objects and arrays 
(technically one, since arrays are objects). When you create an object, that value is not directly 
assigned to the variable. Instead, a reference to that value is what gets set. All that variable 
knows about is the location of the object in memory, not the object itself.

2.Difference bw == and ===
Double equals (==) is a comparison operator, which transforms the operands having the same type 
before comparison.=== (Triple equals) is a strict equality comparison operator in JavaScript, 
which returns false for the values which are not of a similar type. This operator performs type 
casting for equality. If we compare 2 with “2” using ===, then it will return a false value.

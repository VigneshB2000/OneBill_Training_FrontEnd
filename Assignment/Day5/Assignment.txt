Working of JavaScript:

Every time we run a JavaScript program, our code is first received by the "parser" inside the JS 
engine. The parser's job is to check the JavaScript code for syntactic errors in line by line 
manner because JavaScript is an interpretive scripting language, so whenever an error is detected 
by the parser, it throws a kind of error and stops execution of the code.

Once the parser checks all JavaScript codes and gets satisfied that there are no mistakes/errors 
in the code, it creates the data structure called AST (it stands for Abstract Syntax Tree).

Once the Abstract Syntax Tree is created by the parser, the JavaScript engine converts the 
JavaScript code into the machine code (or in the language that machine can understand).

When the program written in the JavaScript gets converted in the machine language (or in byte code)
, the converted code is sent to the system for execution, and finally, that byte code run by the 
system/engine.

Mutable and Immutable in Javascript:

Mutable is a type of variable that can be changed. In JavaScript, only objects and arrays are 
mutable, not primitive values.
A mutable object is an object whose state can be modified after it is created.
Immutables are the objects whose state cannot be changed once the object is created.

1.Difference between innerText and innerHTML.

innerText is used to print the plain text information between tags and requires some layout 
system information. It also ignores the space.
innerHTML is used to print content between labels, including text information. Cross site 
security attaks are the main disadvantage of innerHTML.
the innerText property sets or returns the text content as plain text of the specified node, and 
all its descendants whereas the innerHTML property gets and sets the plain text or HTML contents 
in the elements. Unlike innerText, inner HTML lets you work with HTML rich text and doesnâ€™t 
automatically encode and decode text.

2.Difference between querySelector and querySelectorAll.

The difference between querySelector() and querySelectorAll() is that querySelector() returns a 
single object with the first HTML element that matches the 'selectors', but querySelectorAll() 
returns an array of objects with all the HTML elements that match the 'selectors'.

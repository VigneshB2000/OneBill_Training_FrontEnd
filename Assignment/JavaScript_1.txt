1.History of JavaScript:

Brendan Eich created JavaScript in 1995 while he was at Netscape Communications Corporation, 
the creators of the legendary Netscape Navigator web browser.The early versions of JavaScript 
were called Mocha. Not long after a Mocha prototype was introduced into Netscape Communicator 
(May 1995), it was renamed to LiveScript, purely because the world Live was better for marketing.
 It was renamed again in December of the same year, this time into JavaScript.

What is javaScript:
avaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on 
web pages — every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information 
for you to look at — displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics,
scrolling video jukeboxes, etc.

Why JavaScript:

Back in 1995, Netscape Communicator (a paid internet browser) was by far the most popular web 
browser in the world. The founder of Netscape Communications, Marc Andreeseen, wanted to make the 
web more dynamic by making animations, user interaction, and other types of automation a standard
part of any website. 

He also knew that Microsoft was hard at work on their own browser, Internet Explorer, and wanted 
to make Netscape Communicator more attractive to developers by equipping it with both an 
enterprise-level coding language (Java) and a smaller scripting language (JavaScript).

While this plan didn’t stop Microsoft from taking over the web browser market and driving Netscape
Communications out of business, JavaScript nonetheless managed to escape its “walled garden” 
roots.

3.What is JavaScript Engine?

A JavaScript engine is a software component that executes JavaScript code. The first JavaScript 
engines were mere interpreters, but all relevant modern engines use just-in-time compilation for 
improved performance.JavaScript engines are typically developed by web browser vendors, and every major browser has 
one. In a browser, the JavaScript engine runs in concert with the rendering engine via the 
Document Object Model.

4.Difference between JavaScript and ECMAScript:

JavaScript

JavaScript was first known as LiveScript, but Netscape changed its name to JavaScript, possibly 
because of the excitement being generated by Java. JavaScript made its first appearance in 
Netscape 2.0 in 1995 with the name LiveScript. The general-purpose core of the language has been 
embedded in Netscape, Internet Explorer, and other web browsers.
The standard of scripting languages like JavaScript is ECMAScript.

ECMAScript

The full form of ECMA is European Computer Manufacturer's Association. ECMAScript is a Standard 
for scripting languages such as JavaScript, JScript, etc. It is a trademark scripting language 
specification. JavaScript is a language based on ECMAScript. A standard for scripting languages 
like JavaScript, JScript is ECMAScript. JavaScript is considered as one of the most popular 
implementations of ECMAScript.

5.What is diff bw ECMA and Ecmascript?

ECMA - European Computer Manufacturers Association

ECMAScript - European Computer Manufacturers Association Script

ECMAScript (European Computer Manufacturers Association Script) is a scripting language based on 
JavaScript. Invented by Brendan Eich at Netscape, ECMAScript made its first appearance in the 
Navigator 2.0 browser. It later started appearing in succeeding browser versions of Netscape as 
well as other browsers. ECMAScript is widely used on the World Wide Web especially for client-side
scripting.

Ecma International (formally European Computer Manufacturers Association) is a non-profit 
organization that develops standards in computer hardware, communications, and programming 
languages.

6.Datatypes in JavaScript:

Data Types	Description	                                          Example
String	represents textual data	                             'hello', "hello world!" etc
Number	an integer or a floating-point number	            3, 3.234, 3e-2 etc.
BigInt	an integer with arbitrary precision	                  900719925124740999n , 1n etc.
Boolean	Any of two values: true or false	                  true and false
undefined	a data type whose variable is not initialized	      let a;
null	denotes a null value	                                    let a = null;
Symbol	data type whose instances are unique and immutable	let value = Symbol('hello');
Object	key-value pairs of collection of data	            let student = { };
__________________________________________________________________________________________________

9.Null and Undefined:

Null: It is the intentional absence of the value. It is one of the primitive values of JavaScript.

Undefined: It means the value does not exist in the compiler. It is the global object.
